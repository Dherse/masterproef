# Master's thesis

This is the repo containing the raw files of my master's thesis. They are made using [typst].

## Intellectual property
I am not 100% clear on the intellectual property rights, what I know is that it can be made public for **personal use** only, and you must cite it correctly for it to be useable. However, I do believe that the intellectual property of this thesis is owned by Ghent University. Regarding the template, you can use it, modify it, distribute it, you don't even need to cite me. Regarding the fonts: UGent Panno Text is the **property of the University of Ghent** you **cannot use it unless it is specifically for tasks relating to the University of Ghent**. The fonts are available publically online, which is why I don't mind having them public, but be warned, you **cannot use them**! The other fonts have their own licenses which should be permissive enough, **check them to be sure they are appropriate for your use case**.

Therefore, for the files in `elems` you can assume an `MIT` license, for all of the rest, I ask that you refrain from using them as the copyright is not clear, with regards to the ideas, I believe they mostly belong to Ghent University.

Looking into the contract I signed with the university, the results are theirs, it does not mention ideas and concepts. However, I believe they likely belong to them as well. However, the university, under their [open access policy], publishes the work under [Creative Commons license]. This thesis was **not** submitted to any confidentiality agreement, nor did I sign any, I was not made aware of any confidential information, nor is any shared within this document.

If however, it so happens that I could not publish these files, I ask that the university contacts me and I will make my thesis private. As I have seen many other public master theses and PhD theses, I believe this is okay to do.

## Names
There are names in this thesis, the people mentioned are aware that they are present in my acknowledgement, and I asked them **specifically** for their permission. However, if they wish to be removed from the public file, they can let me know and I'll remove their name and do my best to remove it from the GIT history.

## Compilation
This document will be easily compiled on typst once v0.7.0 lands :)
