= The PHÔS programming language <sec_phos>

From all of the information that has been presented so far regarding translation of intent and requirements (@sec_intent), programming paradigms (@sec_paradigms), and with the inadequacies of existing languages (@sec_language_summary), it is now apparent that it may be interesting to create a new language which would benefit from dedicated semantics, syntax, and integrates elements from fitting programming paradigms. This language should be designed in such a way that it is able to easily and clearly express the intent of the circuit designer, while also being able to translate this code into a programmable format for the hardware. Additionally, this language should be similar enough to languages that are common within the scientific community such that it is easy to learn for engineers. Finally, this language should be created in such a way that it provides both the level of control needed for circuit design, and the level of abstraction needed to clearly express complex ideas. Indeed, the language that is presented in this thesis, @phos, is designed to fulfill these lofty goals.

In the following sections, the initial specification, the syntax, constraint system, and other various elements of the language will be discussed. Then, in @sec_examples, examples will be shown how the language can be used to express various circuits. However, before discussing the language in itself, it is important to discuss the design of the languages, the existing languages it draws inspiration from, and the lessons it incorporates from them.

Due to the complexity of implementing a software ecosystem, PHÔS is still in its infancy. While some components were created and tested, such as the _parser_, the _abstract syntax tree_, and a _syntax highlighter_, the language is not currently usable. Therefore, the language is a work in progress and the syntax is subject to changes. Additionally, examples serve as a way to illustrate the language and are not necessarily valid.
