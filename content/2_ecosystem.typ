= Programming of photonic processors

== Analysis of existing software ecosystems

=== Compiler and runime

=== Code editors

=== Formatting

=== Linting

=== Testing

=== Debugging

#info_box(kind: "important")[
    With the previous sections, it can be seen that creating a user-friendly ecosystem revolves around the creation of tools to aid in development. The compiler and language cannot be created in isolation, and the ecosystem as a whole has to be considered to achieve the broadest possible adoption.

== Analysis of programming paradigms

=== Imperative programming

=== Functional programming

=== Object-oriented programming

=== Logic programming

=== Dataflow programming

#info_box(kind: "important")[
    This section has outlined different approaches for the selection of a programming paradigm. However, it is clear, and will be further demonstrated in @the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly that dataflow programming is the most suitable for the development circuits for photonic processors.
