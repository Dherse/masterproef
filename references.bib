	abstract = {Recent advances in photonic integration have propelled microwave photonic technologies to new heights. The ability to interface hybrid material platforms to enhance light–matter interactions has led to the development of ultra-small and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators, low-noise frequency synthesizers and chip signal processors with orders-of-magnitude enhanced spectral resolution. On the other hand, the maturity of high-volume semiconductor processing has finally enabled the complete integration of light sources, modulators and detectors in a single microwave photonic processor chip and has ushered the creation of a complex signal processor with multifunctionality and reconfigurability similar to electronic devices. Here, we review these recent advances and discuss the impact of these new frontiers for short- and long-term applications in communications and information processing. We also take a look at the future perspectives at the intersection of integrated microwave photonics and other fields including quantum and neuromorphic photonics.},

            Technologies for efficient generation and fast scanning of narrow free-space laser beams find major applications in three-dimensional (3D) imaging and mapping, like Lidar for remote sensing and navigation, and secure free-space optical communications. The ultimate goal for such a system is to reduce its size, weight, and power consumption, so that it can be mounted on, e.g. drones and autonomous cars. Moreover, beam scanning should ideally be done at video frame rates, something that is beyond the capabilities of current opto-mechanical systems. Photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology holds the promise of achieving low-cost, compact, robust and energy-efficient complex optical systems. PICs integrate, for example, lasers, modulators, detectors, and filters on a single piece of semiconductor, typically silicon or indium phosphide, much like electronic integrated circuits. This technology is maturing fast, driven by high-bandwidth communications applications, and mature fabrication facilities. State-of-the-art commercial PICs integrate hundreds of elements, and the integration of thousands of elements has been shown in the laboratory. Over the last few years, there has been a considerable research effort to integrate beam steering systems on a PIC, and various beam steering demonstrators based on optical phased arrays have been realized. Arrays of up to thousands of coherent emitters, including their phase and amplitude control, have been integrated, and various applications have been explored. In this review paper, I will present an overview of the state of the art of this technology and its opportunities, illustrated by recent breakthroughs.},

            Programmable integrated photonic circuits have been called upon to lead a new revolution in information systems by teaming up with high speed digital electronics and in this way, adding unique complementary features supported by their ability to provide bandwidth-unconstrained analog signal processing. Relying on a common hardware implemented by two-dimensional integrated photonic waveguide meshes, they can provide multiple functionalities by suitable programming of their control signals. Scalability, which is essential for increasing functional complexity and integration density, is currently limited by the need to precisely control and configure several hundreds of variables and simultaneously manage multiple configuration actions. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate two different approaches towards management automation in programmable integrated photonic circuits. These enable the simultaneous handling of circuit self-characterization, auto-routing, self-configuration and optimization. By combining computational optimization and photonics, this work takes an important step towards the realization of high-density and complex integrated programmable photonics.},

We leverage the popular deep-learning framework PyTorch to reimagine photonic circuits as sparsely connected complex-valued neural networks. This allows for highly parallel simulation of large photonic circuits on graphical processing units in time and frequency domain while all parameters of each individual component can easily be optimized with well-established machine learning algorithms such as backpropagation.},

Universal, phase-stable, reconfigurable multimode interferometers (quantum photonic processors) enable manipulation of photonic quantum states and are one of the main components of photonic quantum computers in various architectures. In this paper, we report the realization of the largest quantum photonic processor to date. The processor enables arbitrary unitary transformations on its 20 input modes with a fidelity of (\$F\_\{Haar\} = 97.4 {\textbackslash}\%\$, \$F\_\{Perm\} = 99.5 {\textbackslash}\%\$), an average optical loss of 2.9 dB/mode, and high-visibility quantum interference (\$V\_\{HOM\} = 98 {\textbackslash}\%\$). The processor is realized in Si\$\_3\$N\$\_4\$ waveguides.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We propose a novel filter circuit that incorporates a double ring resonator with a balanced Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The circuit has a response equivalent to a conventional ring loaded MZI filter, but with added flexibility in terms of configurability. The second-order filter can also be cascaded to realize higher-order filters. The circuit incorporates a two-stage input and output coupler to further reduce the effect of dispersion. A combination of local and global optimization strategies to program the filter, using tailored objective functions, have been tested in simulation and experiments. To our best knowledge, this is the first time a global optimization strategy is directly used in ARMA filter synthesis and simulation without any additional requirement. We further extend the optimization strategy into experiments and demonstrated its use in practical case for programmable filter circuits.},
