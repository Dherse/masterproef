	abstract = {Recent advances in photonic integration have propelled microwave photonic technologies to new heights. The ability to interface hybrid material platforms to enhance light–matter interactions has led to the development of ultra-small and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators, low-noise frequency synthesizers and chip signal processors with orders-of-magnitude enhanced spectral resolution. On the other hand, the maturity of high-volume semiconductor processing has finally enabled the complete integration of light sources, modulators and detectors in a single microwave photonic processor chip and has ushered the creation of a complex signal processor with multifunctionality and reconfigurability similar to electronic devices. Here, we review these recent advances and discuss the impact of these new frontiers for short- and long-term applications in communications and information processing. We also take a look at the future perspectives at the intersection of integrated microwave photonics and other fields including quantum and neuromorphic photonics.},

            Technologies for efficient generation and fast scanning of narrow free-space laser beams find major applications in three-dimensional (3D) imaging and mapping, like Lidar for remote sensing and navigation, and secure free-space optical communications. The ultimate goal for such a system is to reduce its size, weight, and power consumption, so that it can be mounted on, e.g. drones and autonomous cars. Moreover, beam scanning should ideally be done at video frame rates, something that is beyond the capabilities of current opto-mechanical systems. Photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology holds the promise of achieving low-cost, compact, robust and energy-efficient complex optical systems. PICs integrate, for example, lasers, modulators, detectors, and filters on a single piece of semiconductor, typically silicon or indium phosphide, much like electronic integrated circuits. This technology is maturing fast, driven by high-bandwidth communications applications, and mature fabrication facilities. State-of-the-art commercial PICs integrate hundreds of elements, and the integration of thousands of elements has been shown in the laboratory. Over the last few years, there has been a considerable research effort to integrate beam steering systems on a PIC, and various beam steering demonstrators based on optical phased arrays have been realized. Arrays of up to thousands of coherent emitters, including their phase and amplitude control, have been integrated, and various applications have been explored. In this review paper, I will present an overview of the state of the art of this technology and its opportunities, illustrated by recent breakthroughs.},

            Programmable integrated photonic circuits have been called upon to lead a new revolution in information systems by teaming up with high speed digital electronics and in this way, adding unique complementary features supported by their ability to provide bandwidth-unconstrained analog signal processing. Relying on a common hardware implemented by two-dimensional integrated photonic waveguide meshes, they can provide multiple functionalities by suitable programming of their control signals. Scalability, which is essential for increasing functional complexity and integration density, is currently limited by the need to precisely control and configure several hundreds of variables and simultaneously manage multiple configuration actions. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate two different approaches towards management automation in programmable integrated photonic circuits. These enable the simultaneous handling of circuit self-characterization, auto-routing, self-configuration and optimization. By combining computational optimization and photonics, this work takes an important step towards the realization of high-density and complex integrated programmable photonics.},

Universal, phase-stable, reconfigurable multimode interferometers (quantum photonic processors) enable manipulation of photonic quantum states and are one of the main components of photonic quantum computers in various architectures. In this paper, we report the realization of the largest quantum photonic processor to date. The processor enables arbitrary unitary transformations on its 20 input modes with a fidelity of (\$F\_\{Haar\} = 97.4 {\textbackslash}\%\$, \$F\_\{Perm\} = 99.5 {\textbackslash}\%\$), an average optical loss of 2.9 dB/mode, and high-visibility quantum interference (\$V\_\{HOM\} = 98 {\textbackslash}\%\$). The processor is realized in Si\$\_3\$N\$\_4\$ waveguides.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We propose a novel filter circuit that incorporates a double ring resonator with a balanced Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The circuit has a response equivalent to a conventional ring loaded MZI filter, but with added flexibility in terms of configurability. The second-order filter can also be cascaded to realize higher-order filters. The circuit incorporates a two-stage input and output coupler to further reduce the effect of dispersion. A combination of local and global optimization strategies to program the filter, using tailored objective functions, have been tested in simulation and experiments. To our best knowledge, this is the first time a global optimization strategy is directly used in ARMA filter synthesis and simulation without any additional requirement. We further extend the optimization strategy into experiments and demonstrated its use in practical case for programmable filter circuits.},

This work details the overall architecture and compiler workflow for qcor, and provides a number of illuminating programming examples demonstrating its utility for near-term variational tasks, quantum algorithm expression, and feed-forward error correction schemes.},

	abstract = {Our objective is to understand the notion of
              type
              in programming languages, present a model of typed, polymorphic programming languages that reflects recent research in type theory, and examine the relevance of recent research to the design of practical programming languages.
            
            Object-oriented languages provide both a framework and a motivation for exploring the interaction among the concepts of type, data abstraction, and polymorphism, since they extend the notion of type to data abstraction and since type inheritance is an important form of polymorphism. We develop a λ-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages.
            The evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed λ-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction.
            The typed λ-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for the augmented λ-calculus are discussed.
            The augmented typed λ-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun instead of λ is the functional abstraction keyword and because it is pleasant to deal with.
            Fun is mathematically simple and can serve as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive than those of existing programming languages. In particular, it provides a basis for the design of strongly typed object-oriented languages.},

	abstract = {Despite using them every day, most software engineers know little about how programming languages are designed and implemented. For many, their only experience with that corner of computer science was a terrifying "compilers" class that they suffered through in undergrad and tried to blot from their memory as soon as they had scribbled their last NFA to DFA conversion on the final exam.That fearsome reputation belies a field that is rich with useful techniques and not so difficult as some of its practitioners might have you believe. A better understanding of how programming languages are built will make you a stronger software engineer and teach you concepts and data structures you'll use the rest of your coding days. You might even have fun.This book teaches you everything you need to know to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. You'll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused.Starting from main(), you will build a language that features rich syntax, dynamic typing, garbage collection, lexical scope, first-class functions, closures, classes, and inheritance. All packed into a few thousand lines of clean, fast code that you thoroughly understand because you wrote each one yourself},

	abstract = {Haskell functions are defined as a series of clauses consisting of patterns that are matched against the arguments in the order of definition. In case an input is not matched by any of the clauses, an error occurs. Therefore it is desirable to statically prove that the function is defined for all well-typed inputs. Conversely, a clause that can never be matched also indicates a likely defect. Analyzing these properties is challenging due to presence of GADT and guards as well as due to Haskell's lazy evaluation. We implement a recently proposed algorithm that unifies and extends the related analyses implemented in version 7 of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. By using an SMT solver to handle the semantic constraints arising from pattern guards, we achieve a further improvement in precision over the existing GHC 8.0.1 implementation. We present a tool that uses the analysis to give sound, more precise, and actionable warnings about program defects.},

To utilize the full potential of such circuits, special software routines need to be developed to determine the optical paths inside the mesh. Right now, current methods either scale exponentially in problem size or are severely lacking performance-wise, largely unable to find solutions, especially in recirculating waveguide meshes with square or hexagonal unit cells. We present an algorithm that computes an efficient configuration that correctly routes all given signals. Whereas similar papers look at meshes containing 7 to 20 hexagonal cells, in this paper, meshes of up to hundreds of hexagonal cells are considered. We compare the results of our algorithm to an earlier proposed algorithm and to an optimal solution. Several parameters are introduced in the algorithm. These are studied and an optimizer is implemented to determine effective values for them.},

	abstract = {The number of parameters in deep neural networks (DNNs) is scaling at about 5\${\textbackslash}times\$ the rate of Moore's Law. To sustain this growth, photonic computing is a promising avenue, as it enables higher throughput in dominant general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) operations in DNNs than their electrical counterpart. However, purely photonic systems face several challenges including lack of photonic memory and accumulation of noise. In this paper, we present an electro-photonic accelerator, ADEPT, which leverages a photonic computing unit for performing GEMM operations, a vectorized digital electronic ASIC for performing non-GEMM operations, and SRAM arrays for storing DNN parameters and activations. In contrast to prior works in photonic DNN accelerators, we adopt a system-level perspective and show that the gains while large are tempered relative to prior expectations. Our goal is to encourage architects to explore photonic technology in a more pragmatic way considering the system as a whole to understand its general applicability in accelerating today's DNNs. Our evaluation shows that ADEPT can provide, on average, 5.73\${\textbackslash}times\$ higher throughput per Watt compared to the traditional systolic arrays (SAs) in a full-system, and at least 6.8\${\textbackslash}times\$ and \$2.5{\textbackslash}times\$ better throughput per Watt, compared to state-of-the-art electronic and photonic accelerators, respectively.},

The FBG sensors were interrogated with a measurement system capable of determining the Bragg wavelength in a few seconds over a spectral range of 60 nm (around 1.53 \&mu;m) with an absolute accuracy better than 1 pm. A polarization scrambler was used to account for polarization effects. Excellent consistence between the values of electrical strain gauges and the FBG sensors were found during all measurements. However because this method shows drawbacks in a harsher environment such as a flight test, we are currently investigating the possibilities of integrating FBG sensors into the varnish of the structures. For reasons of their better mechanical performance we use FBG sensors produced on the fiber draw-tower with a special UV-curable coating. The sensors are integrated into an original Airbus varnish build- up. We observed linear strain sensitivities in a temperature range between -50 and +100 \&deg;C. Furthermore, at negative temperatures we found a vanish- induced polarization dependence which could be used to differentiate between strain and temperature effects.},

In the oil and gas industry, distributed ﬁber–optic sensors can provide signiﬁcantly valuable information throughout the life cycle of a well and can monitor pipelines transporting hydrocarbons over great distances. Here, we review the deployment of ﬁber–optic Rayleigh–based distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), Raman–based distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and Brillouin–based distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) in the oil and gas industry. In particular, we describe the operation principle and basic experimental setups of the DAS, DTS, and DTSS, highlighting their applications in the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry. We further developed a prototype of a ﬁber–optic hybrid DAS–DTS system that simultaneously measures vibration and temperature along a multimode ﬁber (MMF). The reported hybrid sensing system was tested in an operational oil well. This work also discusses the challenges that might hinder the growth of the distributed ﬁber–optic sensing market in the petroleum industry, and we further point out the future directions of related research.},

A novel sensor based on a one-dimensional ternary photonic crystal is proposed for the detection of cancer cells. The proposed structure consists of a defect layer sandwiched between two identical periodic numbers. The defect layer can be either normal or cancerous cells. The proposed structure is air /(Si/Bi4Ge3O12/SiO2)N /Defect layer/ (Si/Bi4Ge3O12/SiO2)N /air. The transmission spectra are investigated using the transfer matrix method. The effects of variation of the incident angle, the defect layer thickness, and the number of periods on the sensitivity and the photonic bandgap width are exhaustively investigated. An extremely high sensitivity of 3282.09 nm/RIU is obtained and a very low detection limit of 0.0001 RIU is achieved for the proposed detector. Moreover, the proposed sensor has low cost, easy to design with a nano-scale size. The aforementioned outcomes could open up an effective and applicable path for cancerous cells diagnosis.},

	abstract = {High-performance kernel libraries are critical to exploiting accelerators and specialized instructions in many applications. Because compilers are difficult to extend to support diverse and rapidly-evolving hardware targets, and automatic optimization is often insufficient to guarantee state-of-the-art performance, these libraries are commonly still coded and optimized by hand, at great expense, in low-level C and assembly. To better support development of high-performance libraries for specialized hardware, we propose a new programming language, Exo, based on the principle of exocompilation: externalizing target-specific code generation support and optimization policies to user-level code. Exo allows custom hardware instructions, specialized memories, and accelerator configuration state to be defined in user libraries. It builds on the idea of user scheduling to externalize hardware mapping and optimization decisions. Schedules are defined as composable rewrites within the language, and we develop a set of effect analyses which guarantee program equivalence and memory safety through these transformations. We show that Exo enables rapid development of state-of-the-art matrix-matrix multiply and convolutional neural network kernels, for both an embedded neural accelerator and x86 with AVX-512 extensions, in a few dozen lines of code each.},

For more sophisticated signal processing, we experimentally demonstrated an optical lattice filter with four cascaded unit cells capable of dynamically reconfiguring between a bandpass filter and a notch filter. The reconfiguration of the unit-cell and four-cell silicon lattice filter is based on a recursive algorithm, which brings new possibilities to RF photonic processing and a wide range of applications with design scalability to a large number of poles and zeros.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an analog beamsteering approach for enabling flexible hybrid beamforming design that can achieve performance close to singular value decomposition (SVD) based digital beamforming with single user case. As a starting point, assuming the use of a codebook with infinite precision, we apply transposes of antenna array response matrices as analog beam-formers at the BS and the UE sides. The resulting effective chan-nel matrix including both propagation channel and analog beam-formers is shown to be able to provide a maximal achievable rate very close to SVD based digital beamforming at low to medium SNR. Next, the impact of a finite size codebook is analyzed for practical analog beamformer design. A closed-form derivation is obtained for mapping rate loss to the number of antennas, code-book sizes and the received SNR. The analysis shows that in or-der to achieve performance comparable to analog beamforming with infinite precision, the codebook size should be at least larger than the number of implemented antennas. Therefore, the pro-posed analog beamforming approach can be designed inde-pendently without taking digital beamforming into account. Such an approach can lead to the development of flexible hybrid beam-forming architectures that could adapt to a changing propagation environment via agile analog beam selection and maximize spatial multiplexing gain via proper digital beamformer design.},

	abstract = {Implementing any linear transformation matrix through the optical channels of an on-chip reconfigurable multiport interferometer has been emerging as a promising technique for various fields of study, such as information processing and optical communication systems. Recently, the use of multiport optical interferometric-based linear structures in neural networks has attracted a great deal of attention. Optical neural networks have proven to be promising in terms of computational speed and power efficiency, allowing for the increasingly large neural networks that are being created today. This paper demonstrates the experimental analysis of programming a 4 × 4 reconfigurable optical processor using a unitary transformation matrix implemented by a single layer neural network. To this end, the Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) in the structure are first experimentally calibrated to circumvent the random phase errors originating from fabrication process variations. The linear transformation matrix of the given application can be implemented by the successive multiplications of the unitary transformation matrices of the constituent MZIs in the optical structure. The required phase shifts to construct the linear transformation matrix by means of the optical processor are determined theoretically. Using this method, a single layer neural network is trained to classify a synthetic linearly separable multivariate Gaussian dataset on a conventional computer using a stochastic optimization algorithm. Additionally, the effect of the phase errors and uncertainties caused by the experimental equipment inaccuracies and the device components imperfections is also analyzed and simulated. Finally, the optical processor is experimentally programmed by applying the obtained phase shifts from the matrix decomposition process to the corresponding phase shifters in the device. The experimental results show that the optical processor achieves 72\% classification accuracy compared to the 98.9\% of the simulated optical neural network on a digital computer.},

Most of them dier only in one or a few concepts, but this can make a world of dierence in programming. We explain briey how programming paradigms inuence language design, and we show two sweet spots: dual-paradigm languages and a denitive lan- guage. We introduce the main concepts of programming languages: records, closures, independence (concurrency), and named state. We explain the main principles of data abstraction and how it lets us organize large programs. Finally, we conclude by focus- ing on concurrency, which is widely considered the hardest concept to program with. We present four little-known but important paradigms that greatly simplify concurrent programming with respect to mainstream languages: declarative concurrency (both ea- ger and lazy), functional reactive programming, discrete synchronous programming, and constraint programming. These paradigms have no race conditions and can be used in cases where no other paradigm works. We explain why for multi-core processors and we give several examples from computer music, which often uses these paradigms.},

	abstract = {Today's dominant hardware description languages (HDLs), namely Verilog and VHDL, tightly couple design functionality with timing requirements and target device constraints. As hardware designs and device architectures became increasingly more complex, these dominant HDLs yield verbose and unportable code. To raise the level of abstraction, several high-level synthesis (HLS) tools were introduced, usually based on software languages such as C++. Unfortunately, designing with sequential software language constructs comes with a price; the designer loses the ability to control hardware construction and data scheduling, which is crucial in many design use-cases. In this paper, we introduce DFiant, a Scala-based HDL that uses the dataflow model to decouple functionality from implementation constraints. DFiant's frontend enables functional bit-accurate dataflow programming, while maintaining a complete timing-agnostic and device-agnostic code. DFiant bridges the gap between software programming and hardware construction, driving an intuitive functional object oriented code into a highperformance hardware implementation.},

	abstract = {Graphs have provided an expressive mathematical tool to model quantum-mechanical devices and systems. In particular, it has been recently discovered that graph theory can be used to describe and design quantum components, devices, setups and systems, based on the two-dimensional lattice of parametric nonlinear optical crystals and linear optical circuits, different to the standard quantum photonic framework. Realizing such graph-theoretical quantum photonic hardware, however, remains extremely challenging experimentally using conventional technologies. Here we demonstrate a graph-theoretical programmable quantum photonic device in very-large-scale integrated nanophotonic circuits. The device monolithically integrates about 2,500 components, constructing a synthetic lattice of nonlinear photon-pair waveguide sources and linear optical waveguide circuits, and it is fabricated on an eight-inch silicon-on-insulator wafer by complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor processes. We reconfigure the quantum device to realize and process complex-weighted graphs with different topologies and to implement different tasks associated with the perfect matching property of graphs. As two non-trivial examples, we show the generation of genuine multipartite multidimensional quantum entanglement with different entanglement structures, and the measurement of probability distributions proportional to the modulus-squared hafnian (permanent) of the graph’s adjacency matrices. This work realizes a prototype of graph-theoretical quantum photonic devices manufactured by very-large-scale integration technologies, featuring arbitrary programmability, high architectural modularity and massive manufacturing scalability.},
